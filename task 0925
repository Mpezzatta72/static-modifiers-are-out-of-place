Static modifiers are out of place
Rearrange the static modifiers so that the program compiles.


Requirements:
1. The class must have four variables: A, B, C, D.
2. Don't change the main method.
3. Don't change the getA method.
4. There must be 3 static fields in the class.

        Solution solution = new Solution();
        solution.A = 5;

        Solution.D = 5;
    }

    public int getA() {
